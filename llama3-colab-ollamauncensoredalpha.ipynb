It's one of the easiest ways of interacting with open souce models and has a ton of support from the community. One thing we havn't seen online is end-to-end guides on how to finetune a model and then convert it to an Ollama model so it can be used anywhere...so we decided to build one :)\n","\n","In this notebook, we will do the following.\n","1. Finetune Llama3-8B instruct using a novel finetuning method called ORPO. This combines Supvervised-Finetuning with Direct Preference Optimization and happens all in 1 step\n","2. We will install `llama.cpp` and convert our model to `gguf` format and talk about the different options (and how LoRA plays in here)\n","3. We will write our Ollama `Modelfile` which can be thought of as a Dockerfile for Ollama models\n","4. We will locally test and then push our model to the Ollama hub\n","5. We will pull our model on a separate machine and launch it for inference\n","\n","Grab some snacks, buckle-up, and let it rip 🤙!\n","\n","Here's the link to the corresponding [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK7yqqrK2fE&t=1s)\n","\n","#### Help us make this tutorial better! Please provide feedback on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/T9bUNqMS8d) or on [X](https://x.com/brevdev).\n","\n","A note about running Jupyter Notebooks: Press Shift + Enter to run a cell. A * in the left-hand cell box means the cell is running. A number means it has completed. If your Notebook is acting weird, you can interrupt a too-long process by interrupting the kernel (Kernel tab -> Interrupt Kernel) or even restarting the kernel (Kernel tab -> Restart Kernel). Note restarting the kernel will require you to run everything from the beginning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0bb0724a-d33c-46c5-aa8c-1fcf8340b3a8","metadata":{"id":"0bb0724a-d33c-46c5-aa8c-1fcf8340b3a8"},"source":["# Phase 1: Finetune Llama3 with ORPO"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1bf10d7e-22c1-4d26-9fdb-346877cf38c9","metadata":{"id":"1bf10d7e-22c1-4d26-9fdb-346877cf38c9"},"source":["So far, we've released guides on finetuning Llama3 with 2 different approaches\n","1. [Supervised Finetuning](https://github.com/brevdev/notebooks/blob/main/llama3_finetune_inference.ipynb)\n","2. [Direct Preference Optimization](https://github.com/brevdev/notebooks/blob/main/llama3dpo.ipynb)\n","\n","If you havn't taken a look at these, I suggest skimming through the code for the SFT notebook and the explanation at the top of the DPO notebook. TLDR: Most of the finetuning in guides and online use SFT. SFT is good at adapting a model to domain-specific ouput but might also increase the probability of generating outputs that are not as desirable. To solve this issue, we can then perform a process known as preference alignment. This can be done using RLHF or DPO. However, these are both computationally expensive.\n","\n","Enter Odds Ratio Policy Optimization. At a high level, this combines SFT and DPO into 1 neat step which weakly penalizes rejected responses while strongly rewarding preferred responses. Here we optimize for two objectives at once: learning domain-specific output AND aligning the output with out preferences. If you'd like to dive deeper into ORPO, check out MLabonne's [fantastic guide](https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/orpo-llama-3) on

'content': 'You are a helpful assistant knowledgeable about The Art of War.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Chapter : The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy attack and remain unshaken this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect. That the impact of your army may be like a grind- stone dashed against an egg this is effected by the sci- ence of weak points and strong. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen. There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attackthe direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneu- vers. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their com- bination? The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its vic- tim. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision. Energy may be likened to the bending of a cross- bow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is sim- ply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effect- ed by tactical dispositions. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him. The clever combatant looks to the effect of com- bined energy, and does not require too much from indi- viduals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motion- less on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round- shaped, to go rolling down. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy. VI Weak Points and Strong'}]\n","\n","\n","chosen\n","---------\n",". Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy attack and remain unshaken this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect. That the impact of your army may be like a grind- stone dashed against an egg this is effected by the sci- ence of weak points and strong. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen. There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attackthe direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneu- vers. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their com- bination? The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its vic- tim. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision. Energy may be likened to the bending of a cross- bow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is sim- ply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effect- ed by tactical dispositions. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him. The clever combatant looks to the effect of com- bined energy, and does not require too much from indi- viduals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motion- less on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round- shaped, to go rolling down.
